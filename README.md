# Simple RPG
Simple RPG is a multiplayer game where you can team up with friends to defeat monsters. You can chose out of five different classes, each with their different stats.
* Str = strength, which affects the damage you do.
* Dex = dexterity, which affects your hit chance and some damage if you are an Archer.
* Luk = luck, which affects your possibility of critical hits.
* Int = int, which affects skill damage for mages and clerics.

Simple RPG uses mainly Node.js, Socket.io, and Materialize-CSS.
Class and monster information are stored in the json file "library."
