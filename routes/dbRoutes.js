 * How to test:
 *  - Create a test web page
 *  - Use REST Console for Chrome
 *    (If you use this option, be sure to set the Body Content Headers Content-Type to:
 *    application/x-www-form-urlencoded . Else body-parser won't work correctly.)
 *  - Use CURL (see tests below)
 *    curl comes standard on linux and MacOS.  For windows, download it from:
 *    http://curl.haxx.se/download.html
 *
 * Tests via CURL for Create and Update (Retrieve can be done from browser)
